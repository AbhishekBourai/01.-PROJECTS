IT_Incidents_Predicting_Assig_Group_Multi_Class_Text_Classification
=========================================================================


Developed a **Multiclass Text Classification **Model for Client B&V which **predicts the category of ServiceNow IT Incidents** based
on the incident Description applying various ML & DL models (Random Forest, SVM, ANN, LSTM), **reducing average response SLA
by ~35%.**
